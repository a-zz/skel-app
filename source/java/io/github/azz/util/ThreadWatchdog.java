 * A class to manage thread timeouts (and kill them when appropiate). Singleton implementation: just a single instance

 * <br/><br/>
 * This class is intended to avoid thread count buildup when there're slow or mutually-locking threads involved. 
 * 	Therefore it's not designed to stop threads exactly at their timeout time, but eventually within 
 * 	DEFAULT_LOOP_INTERVAL milliseconds afterwards (currently 5000).
