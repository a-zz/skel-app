..:: FEATURES so far ::..

* Designed for quick & dirty (while coherent) deployments.

* Embedded HSQLDB database with connection tracking, transaction support and 
    autoversioning. Data access is in fact abstracted, so support for other 
    database engines can (hopefully) be easily implemented.
    
* App configuration properties support (database-stored)

* Flexible building process for continuous integration workflows. Builtin
    local configuration support for target machine.

* Enterprise-grade utility classes

* App logging via log4j2.

* Optional UI support: GWT 2.8.2 (in branch gwt).

* Tested for servlet container: Apache Tomcat 8.5
