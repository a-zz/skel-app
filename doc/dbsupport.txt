  Adding support for database engines

  github.com/a-zz, 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

..:: Introduction ::..
skel-app is intended as a quick & dirty (while coherent) deployable application;
therefore, HSQLDB is the preferred database engine, as it needs no DBA 
intervention outside the app: the database is just created on the fly at first 
boot; from there on, the DbUpdater class takes care of bringing the database 
version up to the application version deployed.

Anyway, abstract database support is added for flexibiliy, so support for any 
database can (hopefully) be easily added.

..:: Abstract data access model ::..
(Unless otherwise stated, classes referred in this section are found within the
io.github.azz.sql package.)

In order to provide database engine abstraction, data access classes are
implemented from two interfaces:
  	
  * mypackage.da.MyClassDaInterface: data access interface for a certain 
  	consumer class. Defines required access data methods for the class. This
  	in turn extends the general super-interface DaInterface.
  
  * .rdbms.DATABASE_ENGINEInterface: interface for a certain database engine. 
  	This is only useful so far for marking classes related to the engine. 
  	Engines currently supported are listed in the 
  	RdbmsSupport.enumDatabaseEngines member. If a class is valid for a number of
  	engines (i.e. the SQL used is fully compatible between them) it may
  	implement all the related engine interfaces.

The actual data access implementation should be placed under 
mypackage.da.MyClassDATABASE_ENGINE (e.g. .mypackage.da.MyClassHSQLDB). In fact,
it's not necessary to append DATABASE_ENGINE to the class name, as 
engine-related classes are marked via the DATABASE_ENGINE interface; it's 
advisable, though.

Summarizing:

	mypackage. 					--> A package
		MyClass 				--> A data access consumer class
		da.     				--> Data access sub-package
			MyClassDaInterface	--> Data acces interface for the class
			MyClassHSQLDB		--> HSQLDB data access implementation
			MyClassOTHER_ENGINE --> Other RDBMS engine implementation

Engine currently running is got from the DbManager.getDatabaseEngine() method. 
DbManager takes care of determining the selected engine (from the db.url local 
property) and loading the driver class by calling RdbmsSupport.registerDriver().

The utility function DaInterface.getImplClassFor() helps finding the data access 
implementation class for a certain consumer class and database engine.

Every SQL instruction in the data access implementing classes should be 
pipelined through the utility class SqlTransaction, that keep tracks of opened 
transactions, related objects and data connections currently in use.

..:: Implementing data access classes ::..
Figure out we're implementing a new mypackage.MyClass data access consumer 
class. We need to provide:

  * mypackage.da.MyClassDaInterface. Data access interface for MyClass
  	extending DaInterface; must define those methods required in implementation
  	classes. It must be emphasized that the interface name for "MyClass"
  	must be literally named "MyClassDaInterface", as some other interfaces for
  	some other consumer classes may be placed in the .da package.  
  	
  * A mypackage.da.MyCassDATABASE_ENGINE class implementing MyClassDaInterface
  	for every one of the database engines defined in 
  	RdbmsSupport.enumDatabaseEngines.
  	
  * Initialization code in mypackage.MyClass. This is needed to locate the
  	proper implementation class, by means of the DaInterface.getImplClassFor()
  	utility method. E.g.
  	
  	private final static MyClassDaInterface dao = init();
	private static MyClassDaInterface init() {	
		try {
			logger = new AppLogger(MyClass.class);
			return (MyClassDaInterface)DaInterface.
				getImplClassFor(MyClass.class).newInstance();
		}
		catch(Exception e) {
			logger.error("Unable to instantiate data access implementation " +
				class for " + MyClass.class);
			return null;
		}
	}
  	
..:: Adding support for other engines ::..
We should start by adding the engine to RdbmsSupport; particularly:

  * Adding a nemonic for the engine in enumDatabaseEngines
  * Database URL parsing and driver class load in registerDriver()
  
From there on, the method RdbmsSupport.check() can find which data access
consumer classes require an implementation for the new engine. 
  	
..:: Coding-style guidelines ::.. 
In implementing data access classes and interfaces, the following guidelines
should be applied:

  * Don't log at data access implementation classes; automatic logging by 
  	SqlTransaction class should be enough at that level.
  	
  * Data access implementation classes' methods MUST catch SqlException in
  	order to close the transaction in the finally{} block, and then re-throw
  	the exception.
  	
  * Data acces consumer classes' methods (i.e. .mypackage.MyClass) SHOULDN'T
  	catch any exception emerging from implementation classes.
  	
As usual, the best approach to meeting this guidelines is copying code from 
an already-working data access consuming class.
